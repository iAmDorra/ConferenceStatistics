# The goal

The idea of this repo is to have some data and make some statistics.
We need to see how is the percentage of women speakers and how many tech talks are proposed.
I suggest to generate the number of women speakers in a conference and the number of tech talk in all women talks.

# Participation

* Conference name
* Conference year
* Speakers (foreach)
** Speaker full name
** Speaker sexe
* Talk title
* Talk type
